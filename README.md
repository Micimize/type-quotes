Unix utility for feeding quotes to gtypist to type over. 
Currently comes prepackaged with The Art of War (taow) and The Dhammapada (dhammapada)

Examples:
```bash
python type-quotes -f art
 #=> gives you 3 random art quotes to type through

python type-quotes -c 5 taow
 #=> type 5 quotes from Sun Tzu's Art of War
```

                           }
```

Roadmap:
- create build distribution for easy installation
- add tab completion for library texts
- create more library texts and make the "chapters" section recursive and optional.
- add options for:
   - specific chapter and quote
   - reading the text without typing
- stretch functionalities:
   - saving favorite quotes
   - logging scores (haven't gotten gtypist logs to work on my machine, personally)
   - logging a count of the times a user has typed over a quote
