                "\n    It (the art of war) is a matter of life and death, a road either\n    to safety or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry\n    which can on no account be neglected.", 
                "\n    The art of war, then, is governed by five constant\n    factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations.\n    These are:  (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;\n    (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.", 
                "\n    The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete\n    accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him\n    regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.", 
                "\n    Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat,\n    times and seasons.",

                "\n    The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,\n    sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.", 
                "\n    By method and discipline are to be understood\n    the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,\n    the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance\n    of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the\n    control of military expenditure.", 
                "\n    These five heads should be familiar to every general: \n    he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them\n    not will fail.", 
                "\n    Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking\n    to determine the military conditions, let them be made\n    the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--\n    (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued\n        with the Moral law?\n    (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\n    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven\n        and Earth?\n    (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n    (5) Which army is stronger?\n    (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\n    (7) In which army is there the greater constancy\n        both in reward and punishment?\n    By means of these seven considerations I can\n    forecast victory or defeat.",

                "\n    These military devices, leading to victory,\n    must not be divulged beforehand.", 
                "\n    Now the general who wins a battle makes many\n    calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. \n    The general who loses a battle makes but few\n    calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculations\n    lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: \n    how much more no calculation at all!  It is by attention\n    to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose."

This causes\n    restlessness in the soldier's minds.\n    (3) By employing the officers of his army\n    without discrimination, through ignorance of the\n    military principle of adaptation to circumstances. \n    This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.",
